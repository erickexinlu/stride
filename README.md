## Inspiration
UBC's AMS SafeWalk is a program funded by the university that provides students walking home alone at night with the option to call and request a SafeWalk employee to ensure a safe trip home. Our application takes inspiration from this system and turns it into an app-based implementation, with a user flow similar to Uber, and aims to improve the current Safewalk process by implementing real-time status and cutting out tedious calls.

## Technologies
React Native, Node, Express, MongoDB
